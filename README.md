<h1>Hello there :wave:</h1>

<h2>About me :rocket:</h2>

*Hello everyone and welcome to my profile*
As an **IT engineering student**, i started my journey with learning **algorithms and data structure with C and OOP with java** then spent a long period with full stack development using many frameworks for **frontend (react/angular) and backend (laravel/springboot/express/nest..)**
I'm currently interested in **Devops and Cloud** architecture for setting up infrastructure in the cloud and create CI/CD pipelines assuring automation during the whole process from running test to deploying.
