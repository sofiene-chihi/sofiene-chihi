##About me :rocket:

*Hello everyone and welcome to my profile*
As an **IT engineering student**, i started my journey with learning **algorithms and data structure with C and OOP with java** then spent a long periode with full stack development using many frameworks for **frontend (react/angular) and backend (laravel/springboot/express/nest..)**
I'm currently interested in **Devops and Cloud** architecture for setting up infrastructure in the cloud and create CI/CD pipelines assuring automation during the hole process from running test to depoying.
